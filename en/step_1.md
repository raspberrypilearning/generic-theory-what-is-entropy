Entropy is the amount of randomness available in a computer system. There are many ways in which entropy can be increased in a computer system - here are just a few:

- Using operating system sources. Examples include the system time, keyboard strokes, and mouse movements.
- Using radioactive decay, which is the decay of an atomâ€™s nucleus from one element to another. As decay events happen randomly, we can use the time difference between the events to generate random seeds.
- Using semiconductor junction noise. Semiconductors are used in many electronic components and devices (including computers). A diode for example is a type of component that conducts electricity in only one direction using a junction between two types of semiconductor material. When current is flowing, noise is generated which can be sampled in amplitude and used as a random seed. This is how a so-called Entropy Key works.

A lack of entropy is a cryptographic challenge for securing Internet of Things-enabled devices, because sensors and actuators used in real-world applications cannot access sources of randomness such as the ones listed above.
